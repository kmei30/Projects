At the end, we compare the adjusted R^2 values to the current model's adjusted R^2 value and if it is less than the current model's adjusted R^2 value, then we run through another iteration. After running through multiple iterations, we were able to find one variation of a test model whose adjusted R^2 value was larger than the current model of that iteration's adjusted R^2, making it the best possible adjusted R^2 value to be achieved. Therefore, the best adjusted R^2 value only contains the following predictors: comorbidity, sex, edyears, income, charges, race, and pressure. These predictors yielded the largest adjusted R^2 value, meaning that there is a relatively large proportion of variance."
